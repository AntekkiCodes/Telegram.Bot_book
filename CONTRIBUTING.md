# Contributing to This Book

- Try to include editions to _one_ chapter only in each commit/PR.
- Do not create hyperlinks to sections in other chapters. Mentioning them in text is OK.
- If required, each chapter should have its own `docs/` directory.
- Files used in code snippets should be in [`src/docs/`](src/docs/) directory.
- Do not remove/rename files in [`src/docs/`](src/docs/). They are used as hard coded values in examples in the book.
