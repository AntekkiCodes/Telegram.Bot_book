An authorization token (also refered to as: API token, access token, bot token, API key, etc.).

Generating one is very simple - of course, if you have read the [documentation] you already know that :)

Simply contact the [@BotFather] and use the `/newbot` command.

The token should look like this: `123456:somerandomcharacters`. (numbers, a colon and 35 random characters)

The part before the colon is public (your bot ID).

Now that you have your token, **do not share it!** If you lose it, you can always revoke it and generate a new one with [@BotFather].
